                <h1>Teachers</h1>

                <p>Lucas goes to school every day of the week. He has many subjects to go to each school day: English, art, science, mathematics, gym, and history. His mother packs a big backpack full of books and lunch for Lucas.

                    His first class is English, and he likes that teacher very much. His English teacher says that he is a good pupil, which Lucas knows means that she thinks he is a good student.
                    
                    His next class is art. He draws on paper with crayons and pencils and sometimes uses a ruler. Lucas likes art. It is his favorite class.
                    
                    His third class is science. This class is very hard for Lucas to figure out, but he gets to work with his classmates a lot, which he likes to do. His friend, Kyle, works with Lucas in science class, and they have fun.
                    
                    Then Lucas gets his break for lunch. He sits with Kyle while he eats. The principal, or the headmaster as some call him, likes to walk around and talk to students during lunch to check that they are all behaving.
                    
                    The next class is mathematics, which most of the students just call math. Kyle has trouble getting a good grade in mathematics, but the teacher is very nice and helpful.
                    
                    His fourth class is gym. It is just exercising.
                    
                    History is his last class of the day Lucas has a hard time staying awake. Many lessons are boring, and he is very tired after doing gym.

                <h1>Students</h1>
                <p>I provide office hours on campus and expanded phone/virtual office time five days a week. In all cases, if you have questions, ask me before or after class or call me during my available times. E-mail and texts are your last resort for communication provided you have contacted me during my scheduled office times. E-mails and texts sent outside of my planned availability will be deleted. They only create additional work and are ineffective and inefficient.

                    Face-to-face (F2F) office hours are on Monday/Wednesday between 1:30 pm and 2:30 pm or you can call my cell phone between 9:00 am and 1:00 pm on Tues, 9:00 am and 4:30 pm on Thurs or between 1:30 pm and 4:30 pm on Mon/Weds/Friday. If I am unable to take the call, text me your name, and a brief question and I will call you back as soon as possible!
                    
                    Please respect these times, contacting me outside of these times is unproductive, creates extra work, and I will not respond.
                    
                    Course Questions should be posted in the Q and A Forum after checking the Course Announcements. I will not respond to course questions via text or e-mail that 1: should be published in the Q, and A forum, 2: have already been answered in the Q and A forum, or 3: have already been answered in the Course Announcements.</p>



                <h1>Schools academic focus</h1>
                <p>This article draws out the implications for school and classroom practices of an emerging consensus about the science of learning and development, outlined in a recent synthesis of the research. Situating the review in a developmental systems framework, we synthesize evidence from the learning sciences and several branches of educational research regarding well-vetted strategies that support the kinds of relationships and learning opportunities needed to promote childrenâ€™s well-being, healthy development, and transferable learning. In addition, we review research regarding practices that can help educators respond to individual variability, address adversity, and support resilience, such that schools can enable all children to find positive pathways to adulthood.</p>
