                    <p> years in the car business, I can honestly say, “I’ve seen and heard it all.” As with most things, the car business changes constantly. Always inventing new ways of sell a car. However, one thing hasn’t changed. It still needs salesmen to sell their product. Most salespeople are knowledgeable, and upfront. However, it is a business. Salesmen are there to make money. Simply as that. Some just do it a little more ethically then others.

                        This leads us, to the fast talking salesmen. You know the type: tall, dark, handsome, and knows it all. The minute you walk on the lot, he’s on you like white on rice. Equipped with sunglasses, and a cigarette in his mouth, he’s ready to sell you everything but the kitchen sink. With that said, let me start by saying, “get armed”. Buying a car today is a battle. Being prepared will be one of your greatest weapons. Therefore, here are five “Do’s and Don’ts I’ve come up with.</p>

                    <p>First, before you step onto the car lot, know what you want. What are your needs? Know what you like and do not like about your present vehicle. Knowing this ahead of time will help you buy what you want and not what the fast talking salesperson wants you to buy. I’ve seen it. For example, a customer comes to purchase a four-wheel drive truck. He’s living in Buffalo New York and gets 20 feet of snow at a time. However, instead he leaves with a two-wheel drive truck. The customer is all excited; he loves his new red…

                        Buying a brand new car is one of the most important financial decisions a person can make in his life . Due to all the car models and makes available these days , buying a car is almost like buying candy from a store . There is always something that will fit your whims and fancies Unfortunately , a car costs much more than candy and therefore , extra precautions are necessary when deciding upon what kind of car to buy This is why it is important for a person to draw up a personal selection process for buying a car that will cater to his specific needs and capabilities</p>

                    <p>First of all , a person on the market for a car should start by feeding his eyes . Look around you and observe what other people are driving . Do a search car models that catch your eye on the internet and see what the car reviews have to say about it . Print out your top 5 choices for narrowing down the list

                        Second , check your finances and put a spending cap on your purchasing power . A mid priced brand new vehicle will function just as well , if not better than a high priced model . After all , the way a car functions all depends upon the way the owner maintains the car and not how much the owner spent to purchase the car</p>
